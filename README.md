# Messing around with technical game audio
Using my indie video game demo to learn the ropes within C++ and Wwise engine. I am integrating Wwise with this cryengine project to create my own proprietary tools for extended learning. It is quite the learning curve but very exciting to get into, hopefully my builds do not fail :-)
I have created a custom Wwise gain plugin using python dependencies, C++ within the Wwise SDK and DSP math code.
