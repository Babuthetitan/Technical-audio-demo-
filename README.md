# Personal project for Crytek position - Junior audio software engineer
I am using my indie video game demo to showcase the ropes within C++ and Wwise engine. I am integrating Wwise with this unity project to create my own proprietary tools for advanced game audio depth. This project contains both Wwise middleware skills, understanding of C sharp unity skills and Wwise C++ skills.
I have created a custom Wwise gain plugin using python dependencies, C++ within the Wwise SDK and DSP math code.
