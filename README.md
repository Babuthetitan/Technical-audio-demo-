# Learning-CryEngine with Wwise
Using this cry engine breeze demo to learn the CryEngine game engine and its native audio system. I am also integrating Wwise with this cryengine project to create my own proprietary tools for extended learning. It is quite the learning curve but very exciting to get into, hopefully my builds do not fail :-)
I have created a custom Wwise gain plugin using python dependencies, C++ within the Wwise SDK and DSP math code.
